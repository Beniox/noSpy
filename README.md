# noSpy

This project is a simple Node.js + Puppeteer server that:

- Loads a webpage in a headless browser
- Takes a screenshot of the page
- Lets users click on the screenshot to simulate a real mouse click
- Updates the screenshot after the click

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Headless Chromium browsing via Puppeteer
- Stateless frontend with session tracking via IP
- Image click interaction using canvas-style coordinates
- Screenshot updates live after each interaction
- Base64-encoded image embedding (no file writes)
- Express.js server with minimal dependencies

---

## ðŸ“¸ Demo Flow

1. User visits `/` and sees a full screenshot of a remote page.
2. Clicking on the screenshot sends coordinates via GET to the server.
3. Server performs a real browser click at that location using Puppeteer.
4. A new screenshot is taken and immediately rendered.

## ðŸ›  Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beniox/noSpy
cd ismap-puppeteer
```
### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
bun run index.js
```

### 4. Open your browser
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

# Configuration

``` javascript
const DEFAULT_PAGE = "https://github.com/Beniox/noSpy";
const PORT = 3000;
const DEBUG = false;
```



# How It Works

- Sessions are stored by IP address (Map<ip, Puppeteer.Page>).

- On first visit, a headless Chromium instance navigates to the default page.

- A screenshot is taken and embedded directly in the returned HTML using base64.

- JavaScript intercepts user clicks on the image and sends x,y coordinates via fetch POST request.

- Puppeteer clicks on the specified coordinate.

- A new screenshot is captured and sent back to the browser.
